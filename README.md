# PWC Power BI Virtual work experience - Customer Churn Retention

# Problem Statement :
The purpose of this task is to:

- Define proper KPI's
- Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPI's
- Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed
- Customers who left within the last month
- Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
- Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.

# Datasource :
Dataset used for this task was presented by Pwc and customer churn Retention dataset:

Dataset: Customer Churn Retention

# Data Preparation:
Completed the Data transformation in Power Query and the dataset loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modeling.
Customer churn dataset which has 23 columns and 7043 rows of observation
**Data Cleaning:**

- Replaced the value is SeniorCitizen N coverted No and Y converted Yes
- In the new table, one additional conditional columns were added using M-formula:
--loyalty = SWITCH(TRUE(),'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=12,"< 1 year",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=24,"< 2 years",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=36,"< 3 years",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=48,"< 4 years", '01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=60,"< 5 years",'01 Churn-Dataset'[tenure]<=72,"< 6 years")

- Removed Unnecessary columns
- Removed Unnecessary rows
